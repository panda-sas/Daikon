using CQRS.Core.Event;

/*
== Overview ==
The AggregateRoot class, part of the CQRS.Core.Domain namespace, is an abstract base class designed to represent 
the root of an aggregate in a system using the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing patterns. 
It provides a foundation for implementing domain entities that encapsulate business logic and maintain state through events

== Design Considerations ==
The class leverages event sourcing principles, ensuring that all state changes are captured as a sequence of events.
Reflection is used to dynamically find and invoke Apply methods, providing flexibility but also requiring careful implementation in derived classes.
The use of a version number supports concurrency control and conflict resolution in distributed systems.

== Key Properties and Fields ==
_id (Guid): A protected field that holds the unique identifier of the aggregate.
Id (Guid): A public read-only property that exposes the aggregate's identifier.
_changes (List<BaseEvent>): A private list that tracks changes (events) that have not yet been committed to the event store.
Version (int): Public property representing the version of the aggregate, initialized to -1.

== Usage ==
- As an abstract class, AggregateRoot is intended to be inherited by concrete aggregate classes in a domain model.
- It provides mechanisms for tracking and applying events, which are central to maintaining the state of the aggregate in an event-sourced system.
- Derived classes should implement specific Apply methods for different event types to define how each event affects the state of the aggregate.
